## PROJECTS

### Breast Cancer Classification with DenseNet121 and Grad-CAM
**July 2025 – Aug 2025**
**Tools:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, DenseNet121, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Adam Optimizer, Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss, EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, AUC, Grad-CAM, Kaggle Notebooks with GPU/TPU support

- Developed a hierarchical breast cancer image classification pipeline using DenseNet121, achieving strong performance on both binary (benign vs malignant) and multi-class (tumor subtypes) classification tasks.
- Trained and fine-tuned DenseNet121 with early stopping and learning rate scheduling, optimizing model generalization while preventing overfitting.
- Evaluated model performance with confusion matrices, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves, identifying classification challenges between specific tumor subtypes.
- Applied Grad-CAM explainability techniques to visualize class-specific feature activations, enhancing interpretability and supporting potential clinical adoption.

### Environmental Monitoring and Analysis
**Jan 2025**
**Tools:** SQL, MySQL, Python

- Utilized Python and MySQL to analyze and interpret data for environmental monitoring, facilitating informed decision-making processes.
- Used pandas in Python to efficiently process and analyze large datasets for environmental research and analysis purposes.
- Resolved data integration challenges through the development of customized Python scripts for seamless data manipulation and transformation.
- Implemented MySQL database to efficiently store and manage environmental data, ensuring data accuracy and accessibility.

### North East Big Data Hub & National Student Data Hub: Explorer Transportation
**Dec 2024 – Jan 2025**
**Tools:** Python, Tableau, Canva

- Developed a Comprehensive Data Analysis Pipeline: Built an end-to-end workflow using Python (Google Colab) and Tableau, processing over 1M rows of NYC crash data to uncover temporal patterns, geographic hotspots, and contributing factors.
- Created Interactive Dashboards for Decision-Making: Designed 6 Tableau dashboards, including heatmaps and time-series charts, identifying high-crash zip codes (11207) and peak crash hours (4-7 PM) to guide traffic safety improvements.
- Explored Contributing Factors with Advanced Visualizations: Analyzed top crash causes (e.g., driver distraction and failure to yield, over 40% of crashes) using geospatial and bar charts to prioritize interventions.
- Leveraged Machine Learning for Predictive Insights: Built Python-based models predicting crash likelihood with 85% accuracy, leveraging Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and trend analysis.
